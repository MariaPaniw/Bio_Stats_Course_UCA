# Bio_Stats_Course_UCA
Biological and Ecological Statistics using R - A Course of the UCA Biology Department 

###Sessions: 
May 25-June 18, 2015 (Mondays & Wednesdays, 5-7 pm) 
###Location: 
BIOBLIOTECA, Campus Rio San Pedro, Puerto Real (Espacio de Aprendizaje) 

###Course description: 
Biological data collected in the field or even in experimental settings is often very complex and can defy the assumptions of simple ANOVA or regression-based tests of significance. This course reviews these assumptions and then focuses on theoretical background and practical examples of implementing non-linear statistical modeling techniques using the statistical language R. 

This is a hands-on applied course, where students will be introduced to R and will use this platform throughout the course to implement non-linear least square regression, generalized linear models for count and dichotomous data, and non-parametric methods. Students will be provided with data examples throughout the course and will be encouraged to implement the analytical tools using their own data in homework exercises. 

At the end of the course students should:
  -	become familiar with descriptive statistics, inference, and plotting in R; 
  -	get a substantial knowledge of linear and generalized linear models implemented in R.   

###Prerequisites:
Students should be familiar with ANOVA and linear regression as we will go over these concepts only briefly. Students will be working on their own computers and should have R and R Studio installed and ready to go.

Why use R? RStudio?

Some good reason to use R
========================================================
[Overview](#the-essentials-of-r)

- *R is extremely poweful*
- **R is free** - in the sense that you can download and distribute it for free
- **R is free** - in the sense that you can manipulate the source code 
- **R runs well on many computer platforms**
- **R is rapidly gaining popularity**


## The Essentials of R 
*The essentials of R*
========================================================


R is maintained and archived on  [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) 

> CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. Please use the CRAN mirror nearest to you to minimize network load.

Even better reasons to use RStudio
========================================================

Running R in command line can be burdensome!!!

Even better reasons to use RStudio
========================================================

[RStudio](www.rstudio.com) 

> RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.
